            <p>Mostly I focused on the navigation pane at the top of the screen.
               I wanted to make the page easier to both navigate and grade. In
               order for me to accomplish this I fixed the Navigation bar in 
               place so the user can always click on links he would like to visit.
               As it says in the reading, "Headers provide site identity and 
               global navigation, with search and perhaps other tools." With that
               in mind I redesigned the Serpiant logo made it a link to the home
               page and put several useful links underneath it on the left side.
               I also started work on the content section of the page making the
               headers on the content more noticeable and I feel more aesthetically
               pleasing.
               <br>
               <br>
               I feel that my example adheres to basics of site structure because
               it is easier to navigate through. I also feel that getting rid of
               the distracting backgrounds allows the page to breath more freely.
