  I'm Alex Bluhm and I am from Kansas City in particular
  I am from Olathe Kansas, the population of my town is about 131,000
  people. I should take this time to say that most people call me Alex.
  My major is software Engineering, and I hope to one day start
  programming games for the sega 32x and genesis. As for career I
  would like to go into game design or data management or anything really.
  I am very intrigued by software development and wouldn't mind filling
  any position.</div>

  My hobby is fixing electronics.I am very good at fixing slightly older tech. What I really
  <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">love </span>working on is my sega genesis.
  I've modified that thing for composite and S-video because the sega Genesis is
  just so incredibly awesome that it deserves multiple video outputs.</p>

  My favorite qoute is from bernie burns: <blockquote style="font-size: 22pt;"><b>"There is a fine line
      between not listening and not caring. I like to think I have walked that
      line my entire life."</b></blockquote></div>
